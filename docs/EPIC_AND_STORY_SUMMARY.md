## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
✅ **Low Risk:**
- iOS 18+ / Swift 6.1 / SwiftUI confirmed in CLAUDE.md
- StoreKit 2 and CloudKit are native Apple frameworks
- SwiftData persistence layer well-documented

⚠️ **Medium Risk:**
- Core ML diagnostics model (mitigation: placeholder acceptable for v1)
- LLM API for debug console (mitigation: stub/mock for v1)
- Device API availability (mitigation: manual logging fallback)

### Business Risks
⚠️ **Legal/Compliance:**
- Cannabis cultivation legality varies by jurisdiction
- **Mitigation:** Strong disclaimers, hypothesis-based guidance, user responsibility

⚠️ **Monetization:**
- Pro tier value perception
- **Mitigation:** Clear differentiation, valuable free tier, generous trial

⚠️ **Competition:**
- Existing grow diary apps
- **Mitigation:** AI diagnostics, device integrations, polish
