# Story 10.4: Context-Aware Tips System

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** new user learning the app,
**I want** to see relevant tips at the right moments,
**so that** I discover features naturally without overwhelming onboarding.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Tips appear contextually based on user actions (e.g., first watering event → tip about watering scheduler)
2. Each tip displays once per user (dismissible, never shown again)
3. Tips link to relevant guides for deeper learning
4. Tips styled as glassmorphic popovers or banners
5. Tips can be disabled in settings
6. Key tip triggers:
   - First plant creation → "Learn about growth stages"
   - First watering → "Set up watering schedule"
   - First diagnostic → "How diagnostics work"
   - Environment tab opened → "Connect AC Infinity"
   - No events in 7 days → "Keep your diary updated"
7. Tips stored locally with display state tracking
8. Pro users get advanced tips (analytics, export, etc.)
