# Story 11.2: Siri Voice Commands

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user with dirty hands while working with plants,
**I want** to use Siri voice commands to log actions,
**so that** I can update my diary hands-free.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. "Hey Siri, log watering in GroBro" opens plant picker
2. "Hey Siri, when did I last water [plant name]?" returns spoken response
3. "Hey Siri, add note to [plant name]" prompts for dictation
4. "Hey Siri, create new plant in GroBro" launches plant creation
5. Siri responses use natural language (not robotic)
6. Voice commands work with locked screen
7. Commands handle variations: "log water", "mark watered", "I watered"
8. Plant name matching is fuzzy (handles mispronunciation)
9. Multi-plant disambiguation: "Which plant?" with options
10. Voice privacy: all processing on-device, no audio sent to GroBro servers
