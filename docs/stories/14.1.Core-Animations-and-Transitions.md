## Status

## Story
**As a** user of GroBro,
**I want** Implement all animations from design spec: pulse, counter, slide-up, glow, etc.,
**so that** the app provides a premium, cohesive Smart Greenhouse experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Implementation follows Smart Greenhouse design spec
2. Component is reusable and well-documented
3. Performance meets 60fps target
4. Accessibility support included
5. Works across all supported iOS versions
6. SwiftUI previews provided for testing

## Dev Notes

- Apply glassmorphic styling (GlassCard, blur, gradients)
- Ensure smooth animations and transitions
