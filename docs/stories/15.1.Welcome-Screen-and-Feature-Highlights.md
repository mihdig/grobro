## Status

## Story
**As a** new user of GroBro,
**I want** Glassmorphic welcome flow with 3-4 feature cards, skip/continue options,
**so that** I quickly understand the app's value and get started successfully.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Flow is skippable and non-intrusive
3. Progress is tracked and persisted
4. Legal disclaimers displayed clearly
5. User can restart onboarding from Settings
