# Story 11.1: App Intents Framework Integration

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer implementing Siri integration,
**I want** to set up the App Intents framework foundation,
**so that** GroBro can expose actions to Siri, Shortcuts, and Spotlight.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. App Intents framework integrated into project
2. Core app intents defined: LogWatering, AddNote, CheckPlantStatus, CreatePlant
3. Intent parameters configured (plant selection, note text, etc.)
4. Intent snippets configured for Shortcuts app
5. Intent donations implemented for proactive Siri suggestions
6. Intents handle errors gracefully (plant not found, permission denied)
7. All intents respect Pro tier gating where applicable
8. Intents work in background without launching app UI
9. Deep linking configured to open relevant screens after intent execution
10. Testing suite for intent execution
