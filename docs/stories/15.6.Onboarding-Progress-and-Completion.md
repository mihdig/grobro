# Story 15.6: Onboarding Progress and Completion

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** new user of GroBro,
**I want** Progress tracker showing completion percentage, rewards for finishing,
**so that** I quickly understand the app's value and get started successfully.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Onboarding Progress and Completion implemented with Smart Greenhouse design
2. Flow is skippable and non-intrusive
3. Progress is tracked and persisted
4. Legal disclaimers displayed clearly
5. User can restart onboarding from Settings
6. Reduces churn in first 7 days

## Dev Notes
- Follow Smart Greenhouse design spec
- Use glassmorphic cards and neon buttons
- Track completion in UserDefaults
- Analytics: track onboarding completion rate
