# Story 12.1: Home Screen Widgets

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user who checks my plants daily,
**I want** home screen widgets showing plant status,
**so that** I can see watering reminders without opening the app.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Small widget: single plant with next watering countdown
2. Medium widget: 2-3 plants with status badges
3. Large widget: garden overview with quick action buttons
4. Widgets update every 15 minutes via WidgetKit timeline
5. Tapping widget opens app to relevant screen (deep link)
6. Widget configuration allows user to select which plants to display
7. Widgets use Smart Greenhouse glassmorphic styling
8. Widgets show environmental status if device connected (Pro)
9. Empty state widget prompts to add first plant
10. Widgets respect system dark/light mode (always dark for Smart Greenhouse)
