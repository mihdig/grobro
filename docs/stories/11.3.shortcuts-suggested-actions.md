# Story 11.3: Shortcuts and Suggested Actions

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** power user automating routines,
**I want** GroBro actions available in Shortcuts app,
**so that** I can create custom workflows and automation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. GroBro actions appear in Shortcuts app
2. Suggested shortcuts based on usage patterns (e.g., "Log Morning Watering" if user waters daily at 8am)
3. Actions support input parameters and return output values
4. Actions can be chained in multi-step workflows
5. Custom shortcut icons with GroBro branding
6. Shortcuts work in automation triggers (time-based, location-based)
7. Shortcut gallery shows curated examples: "Daily Plant Check", "Weekend Feeding Routine"
8. Shortcuts respect Pro tier limits (e.g., can't log to 4+ plants on Free)
9. Shortcut execution shows confirmation UI or runs silently (user choice)
10. Error handling: shortcuts fail gracefully with user-friendly messages
